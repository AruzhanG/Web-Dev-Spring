        <h1>Travel to Paris</h1>
        <h2 id="first-impression">First Impression</h2>
        <p>After I landed in Paris, <em>I was very excited</em> and couldn’t wait to see the city. I don’t know—maybe I had just dreamed about France so much that I didn’t care about the <strong>huge amount of trash and rats.</strong></p>
        
        <h2 id="Eiffel-Tower">Eiffel Tower</h2>
        <p>When I saw the Eiffel Tower, I was amazed by its size and beauty. The view from the top, with all of Paris below, was absolutely breathtaking. At night, when it sparkled, it felt like pure magic.</p>
