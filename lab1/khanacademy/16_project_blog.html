            I decided to record my teenage life as a blog. So, when I graduate from school, apply to university, and grow older, I will be able to look back at my best years. Hello World! I hope we will be friends.

            This blog was made just for my older self, but it grew bigger than I ever imagined. Now, I don't even need to work because the money I earn from this blog is enough to afford travel, rent, and more. I have millions of subscribers across the world, and this blog is my journey.
